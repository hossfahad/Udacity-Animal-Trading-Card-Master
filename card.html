				<p>Red foxes are generally about 90–105 cm long—about 35–40 cm of this being the tail—and stand about 40 cm tall at the shoulder. Most adults weigh about 5–7 kg, but the largest individuals may approach 14 kg. The red fox has a coat of long guard hairs and soft fine underfur that is typically a rich reddish brown. Its tail is often white-tipped, and it has black ears and legs. Its colour, however, is variable.</p>
